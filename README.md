## About Javier SolÃ­s-GarcÃ­a

Iâ€™m a Spanish AI researcher and engineer, currently wrapping up my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Seville. My background combines applied machine learning with a strong research focus on time series modeling, generative approaches, and real-world deployment in domains like energy, healthcare, and language technologies.

### Main Achievements

- **PhD in Artificial Intelligence** *(in final stages)* â€“ Research centered on fast spatio-temporal imputation using generative models like diffusion and consistency training.  
- **Multiple AI Publications** â€“ Authored and co-authored several peer-reviewed papers in AI, with contributions spanning healthcare, renewable energy, and predictive modeling.  
- **Applied Research with Industry** â€“ Collaborated on funded R&D projects with multiple companies through university-industry knowledge transfer initiatives.  
- **AI for Microbiology & Sustainability** â€“ [VenpraLab](https://venpralab.eu/), an applied research project developing AI-based tools for biogas optimization validated in lab conditions.

### Some personal stuff


- From AndalucÃ­a (1999); grew up with a love for science and nature.  
- I co-lead VenpraLab with my partner (a microbiologist), where we mix science, environmental care, and a bit of startup energy.  
- Avid reader of classic dystopian and sci-fi literature â€” favorites include *1984*, *Fahrenheit 451*, *Brave New World*, and *The Martian Chronicles*.  
- Passionate about cinema and narrative design in video games.  
- Weekend hiker and occasional AI explainer in bars and terraces.

  
### My vision

Over the next 5 years, I want to keep growing as a technical builder by learning from fast-paced, mission-driven teams in the US startup ecosystem. My goal is to deepen my expertise in applied AI and build scalable products that solve real-world problems â€” especially at the intersection of sustainability, science, and technology.
