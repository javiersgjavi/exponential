## About Javier SolÃ­s-GarcÃ­a

Iâ€™m a Spanish AI researcher and engineer, currently wrapping up my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Seville. My background combines applied machine learning with a strong research focus on time series modeling, generative approaches, and real-world deployment in domains like energy, healthcare, and language technologies.

### Main Achievements

- **PhD in Artificial Intelligence** *(in final stages)* â€“ Research centered on fast spatio-temporal imputation using generative models like diffusion and consistency training.  
- **Multiple AI Publications** â€“ Authored and co-authored several peer-reviewed papers in AI, with contributions spanning healthcare, renewable energy, and predictive modeling.  
- **Applied Research with Industry** â€“ Collaborated on funded R&D projects with multiple companies through university-industry knowledge transfer initiatives.  
- **AI for Microbiology & Sustainability** â€“ Leading [VenpraLab](https://venpralab.eu/), an applied research project developing AI-based tools for biogas optimization validated in lab conditions.  

### Most-Prideful Builds

### Most-Prideful Builds

| Project | Role & Stack | Impact |

| **CoSTI** | First author â€¢ PyTorch + Diffusers | New consistency-based model for time series imputation [code]([https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.03.636301v1.full.pdf](https://github.com/javiersgjavi/CoSTI)).  |
| **TIMBA** | First author â€¢ PyTorch + Attention + Time2Vec | Hybrid model for missing value prediction in industrial series. Deployed in predictive maintenance pipelines. |
| **Biogas Optimization Tool** | Lead dev â€¢ Python + Metaheuristics + UX prototype | Decision support software for optimizing microorganism colony configurations in fermenters. Validated through lab testing. |
| **Biodigester Monitoring System** | Developer â€¢ Python + Sensors + Data pipeline | Real-time monitoring and control software for anaerobic biodigesters. [Related paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.03.636301v1.full.pdf). |
| **Contributor to Torch Spatio-Temporal Library** | Puntual contributor | It was my first contribution to open source by fixing a bug in a library I was using, it's not much but I'm just proud of it [Repo](https://github.com/TorchSpatiotemporal/tsl). |


### Experience (TL;DR)

- **Researcher â€“ Universidad de Sevilla** (2019â€“2024). Research in temporal modeling, diffusion models, healthcare AI.
- **Founder â€“ VenpraLab** (2023â€“). AI consulting and experimentation in biotech; client projects + R&D lab setup.
- **Guest Lecturer & Mentor** â€“ Delivered workshops on AI for health, optimization, and generative modeling.
- **Hackathons / Volunteering** â€“ Taught AI basics in rural high schools; built open-source time series tools.

## How I Work

- **Gets me pumped:** tough research problems â€¢ mission-driven products â€¢ experimental validation â€¢ high ownership teams  
- **Disappoints me:** empty buzzwords, bureaucracy, "research for researchâ€™s sake"  
- **Strengths:** research-to-product thinking, fast prototyping, clear writing, cross-domain curiosity  
- **Improvement points:** perfectionism under pressure, learning to delegate better  
- **Known behaviours / comms style:** async-first, clear docs over meetings, nerdy emoji use ðŸ¤“

## Other

### Some personal stuff

- From AndalucÃ­a; grew up with a love for science and nature.  
- I co-run VenpraLab with my partner (microbiologist) â€” we mix science, startup hustle, and environmental care.  
- Fan of Flamenco, Asimov, and vintage sci-fi.  
- Weekend hiker, AI explainer in bars and terraces, fascinated by human intelligence.

### My vision

Over the next 5 years, I aim to scale VenpraLab into a science-driven venture tackling waste-to-energy optimization. In parallel, I want to grow as a technical founder in the US startup scene, learning how to build fast and at scale. I see Exponential as the bridge to compound that learning â€” and bring it back to Spain with stronger tools, mindset, and a global network.
